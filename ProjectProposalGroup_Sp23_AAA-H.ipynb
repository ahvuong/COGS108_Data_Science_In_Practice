    "It is believed that biases based on gender, stereotypes, and obstacles to career advancement are causing higher stress levels among women who work in the tech industry. On top of this, women in this field are also dealing with societal expectations and family responsibilities, making it even harder to balance work and personal life. The study suggests that companies in the tech industry that prioritize inclusivity may be able to improve the mental well-being of female employees."

Our datasets are collected answers from anonymized survey without any sensitive or personally identifying information. The survey was fully voluntary and gave consent-based instructions about the use of gathered data.\n",

    "Our group makes sure there is no bias by aiming to collect and analyze publicly available data and datasets from trusted website for our project. In order to minimize biased based on the different amount of answers from different groups, we will choose a particular group to focus on instead of comparing between different groups because our datasets are voluntary surveys, the responses for each group might be unbalanced. However, our datasets do not exclude any particular populations or likely to reflect particular human biases in a way that could be a problem and the survey questions do not target any particular group or conduct in the way that will lead to a particular group, whether that's defined by sex, age, ethnicity, etc.\n",

    "To detect any biases before our analysis, we will examine the source and methodology of the data collection, and check if there are any gaps or inconsistencies in the data. We will also review the literature on the topic and compare our data with other relevant studies. During our analysis, we will use appropriate statistical methods and visualizations to explore the data and identify any outliers, trends, or patterns that may indicate bias. We will also test our hypotheses and assumptions using inferential statistics and hypothesis testing. After our analysis, we will evaluate our results and conclusions in light of the data limitations and ethical implications. We will also seek feedback from our peers and instructors on our project report and presentation, and address any questions or concerns they may have.\n",
